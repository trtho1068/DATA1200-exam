          <h2>Bats</h2>
          <p>
            Today more than 1400 species of bats exists, which means that more
            than 20% of all mammals are bats. Bat species range in size
            from weighing only a few grams to having an almost two-meter
            wingspan.

          <h2>Muskox</h2>
          <p>
            Muskox are ungulates that are more closely related to sheep and
            goats, than cows. These animals live in arctic environments in the
            northern hemisphere.

          <p>
            Red pandas belong to the family of carnivora, the same group that
            includes animals like lions and bears. Red pandas mostly live of eating
            bamboo, and they can grow to weigh 6,2 kg and be roughly one meter long.

          <h2>Whales</h2>
          <p>
            Whales or Cetaceans are a group of marine mammals ranging in size
            from the largest animal on earth, with a size upwards of 30 meters,
            down to small dolphins that are no longer than a meter.
            Whales are actually ungulates, meaning that they are most closely
            related to animals like the moose. Whales are vocal animals,

          <h2>Lions</h2>
          <p>
            Lions are the most social of cats, they live in groups of 12-16
            animals. Today lions are most often associated with Africa, but
            they can also be found in India. Until 2000 years ago lions actually
            also lived in the middle east and parts of Europe. A lion's roar
            can be heard up to 10 km away.

            Eagles in general are large powerful predatory birds. They are

            species of eagles are not necessarily closely related.

          <p>
            Apes are our closest family, we humans belong to this group together
            with chimpanses, gorillas and orangutangs etc. Except humans, apes
            live in tropical regions. Common for apes are their relatively
            large brains,
