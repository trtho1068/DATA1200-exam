          Personally, these are among my favorites, mainly due to their
          soundproofing and private ambiance.
          It served as the ideal setting for collaborating with my group during
          a home exam.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given its popularity, it's advisable to
          <a href="https://student.oslomet.no/grupperom">
            proactively book the room</a> if you intend to hold a meeting with
          your group in this environment.
        </p>
        <h2>Strategic Workspace</h2>
        <p>
          PH461 serves as the dedicated computer room in building P35.
          Reserved exclusively for IT students like myself, it stands out as
          one of my preferred spots.

          Its generous space and strategically placed
          power outlets contribute to a comfortable environment. If you

          surroundings, this is the ideal spot for you.

          Complete with convenient power outlets and well-designed lighting,
          this space is not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional!
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on my experience, arriving early is a prudent choice, given
          the popularity of this spot; it tends to get occupied swiftly.
          Alternatively, you can also consider visiting later in the afternoon
          or during the weekend for a more relaxed atmosphere.

          I favor sofa seating to alleviate strain on my back.
          Engaging in IT programming for extended periods can take a toll on
          your posture, making comfortable and varied seating crucial.
          I have to give the first place to Elevated Comfort due to its comfort
          and nice view.
