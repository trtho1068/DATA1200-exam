          Let one of us present some of her preferred study places.
        </p>
        <h2>Group Rooms</h2>
        <p>
          PI230-PI238 and PE238-PE242 are designated group rooms,
          designed to comfortably accommodate up to six individuals. These rooms
          offer ease of accessibility and can be effortlessly reserved.

               alt="Photo of a relevant group room.">
        </picture>
        <p>
          Personally, these are among my favorites, mainly due to their
          soundproofing and private ambiance.
          It served as the ideal setting for collaborating with my group during
          a home exam.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given its popularity, it's advisable to
          <a href="https://student.oslomet.no/grupperom" target="_blank">
            proactively book the room</a> if you intend to hold a meeting with your group in this
          environment.
        </p>
        <h2>Strategic Workspace</h2>
        <p>
          PH461 serves as the dedicated computer room in building P35.
          Reserved exclusively for IT students like myself, it stands out as
          one of my preferred spots.
        </p>

        <p>
          Its generous space and strategically placed
          power outlets contribute to a comfortable environment. If you
          appreciate sitting in a corner while staying observant of your
          surroundings, this is the ideal spot for you.
        </p>
        <h2>Elevated Comfort</h2>
        <p>
          Discover these inviting sofa spots situated just above the main
          entrance of the P35 building, offering a picturesque view of
          Holbergsplassen.
        </p>

          <img src="img/elevated-comfort.jpg"
               alt="Photo of the elevated comfort work place.">
        </picture>
        <p>
          Complete with convenient power outlets and well-designed lighting,
          this space is not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional!
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on my experience, arriving early is a prudent choice, given
          the popularity of this spot; it tends to get occupied swiftly.
          Alternatively, you can also consider visiting later in the afternoon or
          during the weekend for a more relaxed atmosphere.
        </p>

      <aside class="side-content">
        <p>
          I favor sofa seating to alleviate strain on my back.
          Engaging in IT programming for extended periods can take a toll on
          your posture, making comfortable and varied seating crucial.
          I have to give the top spot to Elevated Comfort due to its comfort
          and nice view.
