        <h1>Testing our site</h1>
        <p>
          Here we go through how we used automated and manual testing to try and
          improve our site. We've used
          <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/"
             title="Go to Google Lighthouse documentation">
            Google Lighthouse</a> for the automated tests.
        </p>
        <h2>Automated tests</h2>
        <p>
          The first test was run early on the first complete-ish page,
          and gave the following results.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="img/accessibility01.png"
               alt="screenshot of Lighthouse scores"
               class="lighthouse-screenshot"
               width="778"
               height="143">
          <figcaption>

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Our overall accessibility score is 94, not so bad, but there is room
          for improvement. There is also an accessibility related issue in the
          SEO section, we will come back to that. We begin by looking at the
          actual accessibility section of the test results.
        </p>
        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <p>
          There is an issue related to our hamburger menu, where we use a
          checkbox <code>&ltinput&gt</code> element and an associated
          <code>&ltlabel&gt</code>.
        </p>
        <img src="img/accessibility01-labels.png"
             alt="screenshot of form element issue"
             class="lighthouse-screenshot"
             width="778"
             height="60">
        <p>
          Lighthouse complains that the checkbox
          does not have an associated label. Because we do actually state
          what element the label is for, I suspect that this happens because
          our label does not contain any text, but instead contains three
          <code>&ltspan&gt</code> elements each representing a piece of the
          burger.
        </p>
        <p>
          How is a screen reader supposed to read that you ask? I don't
          know. One could imagine adding some text, and then some trickery
          to make it invisible, at the time of writing this is not a priority.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was also a bit naive and assigned <code>role="button"</code>
          to our hidden hamburger menu checkbox, thinking that was all well and
          good.
        </p>
        <img src="img/accessibility01-aria.png"
             alt="screenshot of aria role issue"
             class="lighthouse-screenshot"
             width="778"
             height="60">
        <p>
          After
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/button_role#toggle_buttons"
            title="Read about aria role button on MDN Web Docs"
          >reading about Toggle Buttons on MDN WebDocs</a> I conclude that the
          idea wasn't all bad as we do in fact use the checkbox as a
          toggle button. However, if my understanding was
          correct we should also use the <code>aria-pressed</code> attribute
          to turn the element into a toggle button. Depending on the state of
          the checkbox we would then need to update <code>aria-pressed</code>
          accordingly which I can imagine requires some JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another option which I think might be a slight improvement on both of
          the above issues is to
          <a href="https://unused-css.com/blog/css-only-hamburger-menu/"
          title="Go to unused-css.com burger menu example"
          >add an <code>aria-label</code> to the checkbox</a>. Straight forward
          solution with no JS required, this is what we go for, and later tests
          seem to appreciate the choice.
        </p>
        <h3>SEO</h3>
        <p>
          Lighthouse wants us to be more mobile friendly, more specifically
          by appropriately sizing/spacing our tap targets.
        </p>
        <img src="img/accessibility01-mobile-friendly.png"
             alt="screenshot of tap target issue"
             class="lighthouse-screenshot"
             width="797"
             height="63">
        <p>
          The unapproved targets are the email address links in our footer.
          This issue should be entirely avoidable, but it still lingers.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is one more complaint in the SEO section about documents
          missing a meta description, this has not been prioritized.
        </p>
        <h3>Performance</h3>
        <p>
          A few other issues are grouped under performance and relates
          primarily to images, which at this stage there was only one of.
        </p>
        <img src="img/accessibility01-perf-diagnostics.png"
             alt="screenshot of Lighthouse performance diagnostics overview"
             class="lighthouse-screenshot"
             width="797"
             height="299">
        <p>
          Setting an explicit width and height is fairly straightforward,
          when using the <code>&ltimg&gt</code> tag Intellij will even suggest
          the appropriate values.
        </p>
        <p>
          Properly sizing images is a little trickier. The consequence of too
          large images is wasted bytes and slower page load.
          To improve on what was, we replace the image on the home page,
          with two cropped versions. One for mobile and one for desktop, and
          make sure the sizes are at least closer to the size
          we actually need. And then we try to do better when adding new
          images.
        </p>
        <p>
          To serve images in next-gen formats we convert them to webp.
          In most cases we provide jpg fallbacks for browsers not supporting
          webp.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along the way we also encountered issues with too small fonts, and
          some low contrast, all of which have been improved.
        </p>
        <p>
          We still get complaints about the images on the animals page, but
          these are sized at width 800px, which is not too far away from the
          max-width at which we show them.
        </p>
        <h2>Other considerations</h2>
        <p>
          We have chosen to implement both a light and a dark theme as there are
          many people out there, myself included, who prefer a dark theme most
          of the time. There are also circumstances like light conditions and
          time of day, that may favor one over the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          A full-blown solution including a site toggle button to
          override system/browser settings would require some JavaScript to
          remember theme between page reloads. We do not deviate from our no JS
          policy, and implement only the <code>@prefers-color-scheme</code>
          media query. To see the effect one can f.ex. toggle between light
          mode and dark mode in firefox.
        </p>
        <p>
          While working on the hamburger menu we initially used
          <code>display: none;</code> to make the checkbox invisible, but then we
          realized that doing so makes the checkbox and thus navigation impossible
          to reach using keyboard only. The simple solution is to use
          <code>opacity: 0;</code> instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also make sure that the burger
          has a visual cue when it has input focus, and we intentionally remove it
          from keyboard navigation on wider screens were we always display
          all nav links.
        </p>
        <p>
          The header with site navigation is made sticky on most pages to
          provide easy access. On topical (animals) we prioritized appearance.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have tried to give links meaningful text rather than targeting
          attributes like <code>title</code> and <code>aria-label</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Text is limited at a width of <code>40em</code> to ensure it is
          easy to read, and we put in an effort to maintain vertical rhythm
          through headings, and for different font-sizes. We would have liked
          to transition smoothly between max and min font-size, but didn't
          have the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have tried to make a simple and intuitive UI that should be easy to
          understand and navigate.
